# Gevorderde-Algoritmen
Algorithms implemented *by me* for the course "Advanced Algorithms" (J. Cnops) at the Ghent University (Master of Science in Industrial Engineering: Information Science")

## Build
Use Visual Studio to open the solution and compile all the projects at once. All projects have been tested and are fully working as of 12/2016. 

## Note
It is also possible to use these with the GNU C++ compiler, although some notations might be incorrect.
