# Advanced Algorithms
Algorithms implemented *by me* for the course "Advanced Algorithms" (J. Cnops) at the Ghent University (Master of Science in Industrial Engineering: Information Science)

## Build
Use Visual Studio to open the solution and compile all the projects at once. All projects may of may not be working in the correct "algorithmic" way. 

## Note
It might also be possible to use these with the GNU C++ compiler, although this has not been tested.
